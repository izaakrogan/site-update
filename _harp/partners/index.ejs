	<p>Founders & Coders C.I.C. is a not-for-profit social enterprise. Our aim is to improve the quality and accessibility of technical education everywhere. We are doing this by building a sustainable and repeatable model of community-supported training.</p>

	<p>We provide what is probably the best training in web development in the UK and we don't charge our students anything. The course is largely delivered by graduates and alumni, supported by experienced technical mentors and by employers.</p>

	<p>We have trained more than 100 novices in full-stack JavaScript. Typically 40% of our students are female. 100% of the graduates of our most recent programme are working as web developers.</p>

	<p>In addition to the intensive programme, we also run free and open-access coding courses for the wider community.</p>

	<p>Nikhila Ravi says, <em>"the Founders & Coders course is easily one of the best things I've ever done. I have learnt more useful practical knowledge in sixteen weeks than in a whole year at university".</em></p>

     	<p>We have transformed the lives of many individuals through our educational programmes. One year ago, Besart Hoxhaj was working for less than minimum wage as a waiter in East London. Now Besart is leading a team to build a native iOS application, using React Native. We want to continue to unlock latent potential in individuals like Bes.</p>
	<p>We have achieved all of this largely without external funding and at no cost to our students.</p>

	<p>If you are want to help us to open new schools, develop new programmes, and to create new self-sustaining communities capable of changing lives, <a onclick="fac.nav_scroll('/partners/', 'contact')">please get in touch</a>.</p>

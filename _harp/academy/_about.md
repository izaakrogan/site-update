Founders & Coders runs an intensive full-time, 16-week course is software development using JavaScript and Node.js. Application is highly-selective and we take just 16 students per cohort. After graduation, we expect our students to help us deliver the course to the next cohort and to contribute to our various community projects. In return, we will find you work as a software developer.

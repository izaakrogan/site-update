#Mobile Development

We develop software applications for Web and mobile.

Our approach to building native mobile apps is to build a prototype as a Web app first. Then we port to native platforms, using tools and libraries that include [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/), [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/), [Famous](http://famous.org/) and [React Native](http://www.reactnative.com/).

This approach tends to be significantly less expensive than developing Web and native apps separately and reduces development risk.

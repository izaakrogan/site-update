The Founders and coders course is easily one of the best things I've ever done.

Since taking a few technical classes at university I have wanted to learn how to code properly and applied to FAC thinking it would be a good place to start.

But I have loved it more than I could ever have imagined.

I have learnt more useful practical knowledge in 16 weeks than in a whole year at university.

And I have enjoyed it immensely. Why? Because at FAC we learn to become good programmers because we enjoy coding, not so we can ace a test at the end.

Coding has become an addiction, in the best possible way.

While I constantly felt stressed at university because of the need to perform in exams, I have learnt so much more at FAC because of the friendly, open, non-judgemental atmosphere.

Don't be fooled though, the course is incredibly intense! The learning curve is steep and the course material really challenging. But you're surrounded by a wonderful group of motivated and hard working individuals who are there to learn and help each other. And there's the fantastic mentor group who are willing to talk coding and give you advice at any hour of the day.

Overall, the course has been an extremely empowering and fulfilling experience. It has helped me better understand the language of technology and given me the skills and confidence to build my own technical ideas.

Warning! Founders and coders will change your life.

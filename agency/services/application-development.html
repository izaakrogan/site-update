				<h1>Web application development</h1><p>We develop software applications for the Web using <em>JavaScript</em> and <em>Node.js</em>. </p>
<p>We practice <em>agile software development</em>, where development usually proceeds in a series of two-week <em>sprints</em> and we aim for <em>continuous delivery</em> to the client of working code and <em>testable</em> features.   </p>
<p>We do <em>test-driven development</em> (TDD), where product features are turned into automated tests that demonstrate whether or not the application software actually behaves as expected, and these are written before the code being tested is actually created. We use automated tools to maintain measures of <em>code coverage</em> and to identify failing tests.  </p>
<p>We deliver well-documented code, based around concise README documents, so that in years to come our code will be maintainable, either by us or by others, and that anyone returning to the codebase or looking at it with fresh eyes will be able to understand our original intent.  </p>
<p>We practise <em>paired programming</em> to ensure that all developers involved in a project share a common approach to the codebase and create readable code.  We undertake <em>code reviews</em> on all of our work, where developers not involved in a project assist the development team by reviewing the quality of the code being created.  </p>

				<h1>Prototyping Service</h1><p>Our prototyping service is probably the best-value service of its kind in London.</p>
<p>For £1000 a week a client receives:</p>
<ul>
<li>A product development team, made up of at least two graduates of our academy</li>
<li>A working prototype</li>
<li>An optional practical training in product management</li>
</ul>
<p>The intention of the prototyping service is to help our graduates build a portfolio, showcase their extensive capabilities and build client/employer relationships. We offer this service to ambitious individuals and businesses where we feel there is a good chance of repeat work or employment - particularly once clients understand what our graduates are capable of producing.</p>
<p>We also offer this service to those who are interested in doing something for social good. For example, we are working with Stockport Council on a project around suicide prevention.</p>
<p>Typically, we offer this service to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Startups looking to create an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a></li>
<li>Businesses looking to test out a new idea</li>
<li>Employers looking to recruit developers</li>
<li>Any project that may have a positive impact on the world</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="FAQ2"></a>
<em>What sort of prototypes do you build?</em><br>We build web applications. In other words, software applications that run in a web browser.</p>
<p><a name="FAQ3"></a>
<em>What about mobile phone apps, for iPhone and Android?</em><br>We are certainly capable of this, but it&#39;s generally not something we do for a protoype. In most cases, it is better to build a prototype as a web app first, but we can do follow-up work to convert a web app into a native phone app.</p>
<p><a name="FAQ4"></a>
<em>Why isn&#39;t the price ten times higher?</em><br>As well as being an agency of developers, we are also a coding school. Prototyping projects are generally undertaken by our graduate developers as an opportunity to showcase their capabilities. Ultimately, the aim is for graduates to be commissioned for further work or offered employment.</p>
<p><a name="FAQ5"></a>
<em>What’s the first step?</em><br>You get in touch with us and we&#39;ll invite you to discuss your idea with us at our campus in Bethnal Green. It is important we understand your idea, what you want to achieve, and if or when you are likely to want any follow-up work done. If you wish, you can bring a visual presentation too.</p>
<p><a name="FAQ6"></a>
<em>What happens next?</em><br>If our developers agree that we have a realistic chance of delivering a useful prototype that will meet your expectations, then we&#39;ll arrange a follow-up meeting with you to agree on a <em>minimum set of deliverables</em>, after which we will allocate you the first available start date that is convenient for you and request permission to raise an invoice.</p>
<p><a name="FAQ7"></a>
<em>Why do I have to pay before work starts?</em><br>Demand for our prototyping service outstrips supply and we need to know that clients are committed to the process before we can confirm a date for work to start. But the agency holds payment until the project is complete - money is not paid out to the development team until the successful delivery of the prototype. </p>
<p><a name="FAQ8"></a>
<em>What happens if I&#39;m not happy with the work done?</em><br>If the prototype does not meet the agreed specification, then you can request a full refund and your development team will not be paid.</p>
<p><a name="FAQ9"></a>
<em>What is my involvement in the process?</em><br>You will be the <em>product owner</em> for your project. On the first day of the build you will be expected to work together with your team to develop a series of <em>user journeys</em>, <em>wireframes</em> and <em>user stories</em>.  You will then continue to communicate with your team throughout using <em>Pivotal Tracker™</em>. Finally, you will join them at the end of the project for a presentation and handover.  </p>
<p><a name="FAQ10"></a>
<em>Wireframes?? Pivotal Tracker?? What training will I receive?</em><br>On the first day, if you request it, you will receive training in <em>product management</em>, <em>user experience design</em> and <em>agile development</em>. You will also get an opportunity to work with your development team to produce <em>user journeys</em>, <em>wireframes</em> and <em>user stories</em> and you will be introduced to <em>agile project management</em> using <em>Pivotal Tracker™</em>. Throughout the rest of the project, you will be able to practise what you have learnt in the role of <em>product owner</em> for your project. </p>
<p><a name="FAQ11"></a>
<em>What benefits will I get from the process?</em><br>You will improve your understanding of the software development process and your ability to manage teams of software developers. You will get training and experience in key aspects of product management and user experience design. You will get your own dedicated development team for the length of the project. You will receive a fully-documented prototype at the end of the process.</p>
<p><a name="FAQ12"></a>
<em>What happens if I want further work done on my prototype?</em><br>If you are happy with the prototype, you can retain some or all of your development team to continue to work on it for you.</p>
<p><em>How do I find out more?</em><br>If you have any further questions, please <a href="#contactsection">contact us</a> or tell us about your project using the form below and we will contact you.</p>

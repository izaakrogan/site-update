				<h1>Upcoming Workshops</h1><h2>JavaScript Masterclasses</h2><p>These workshops are for experienced JavaScript developers and are not intended for beginners.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript masterclass: client-side programming with jQuery</strong><br>In this masterclass, we will be looking at the inner workings of jQuery and building our own version of this popular fron-end library. Concepts covered will include the DOM, event listeners and method chaining. Some knowledge of JavaScript is expected and familiarity with jQuery will be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript masterclass: client-side testing with QUnit</strong><br>In this masterclass, we will be using the QUnit JavaScript unit testing framework to do Test-driven development (TDD). There are lots of great test frameworks to choose from, and we have tried most of them, but QUnit is probably the best one for learning the principles of TDD for client-side JavaScript development. A good working knowledge of JavaScript is expected.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript masterclass: introduction to Node.js</strong><br>In this Masterclass, we will be using Node.js to build some simple Web applications. Modules covered will include <em>assert</em>, <em>fs</em>, <em>http</em>, <em>path</em> and <em>process</em>. You don&#39;t have to be familiar with Node.js, but A good working knowledge of JavaScript is expected and an understanding of callbacks.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript masterclass: Node.js and Express</strong><br>In this masterclass, we will be building on the foundations of our <em>Introduction to Node.js</em> to build our own Web application server. This will lead us straight to the Express framework. We will learn not just how to use it, but also how it works. Concepts covered will include routing, handlers and middleware. A good working knowledge of JavaScript and some experience of Node.js is essential for this workshop.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript masterclass: Testing Node.js applications</strong><br>In this masterclass, we will learn how to to test-driven development (TDD) with Node.js and Express, first using <em>assert</em> and then using <em>Mocha</em> for unit testing and <em>Shot</em> for integration testing. A good working knowledge of JavaScript and some experience of Node.js is essential for this workshop.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript masterclass: Node.js and Databases</strong><br>In this masterclass, we will learn how to connect a Node.js or Express application to a database. We will look at some common databases and how to select the appropriate database adaptor for your application. A good working knowledge of JavaScript and some experience of Node.js is essential for this workshop.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript masterclass: building an ORM with Node.js</strong><br>In this masterclass, we will learn how to build an object-relational mapper (ORM) in JavaScript, to connect different data sources to a Node.js application. We will then look at popular ORMs, such as <em>waterline</em>. A good working knowledge of JavaScript and some experience of Node.js is essential for this workshop.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript masterclass: Node.js and Sails</strong><br>In this masterclass, we will be building on the foundations of our <em>Node.js and Express</em> masterclass to look at the <em>Sails</em> MVC framework for Node.js in order to speed up your application development. A good working knowledge of JavaScript and some experience of Node.js is essential for this workshop.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript masterclass: Introduction to hapi</strong><br>In this masterclass, we will be looking at the <em>hapi</em> framework from Walmart Labs and discovering the benefits of a framework that has a well-integrated suite of modules for testing, error-handling, caching and more. A good working knowledge of JavaScript and some experience of Node.js is essential for this workshop.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript masterclass: using Browserify</strong><br>In this masterclass, we will be learning how to use <em>browserify</em> to bring all the power of <em>npm</em> and the <em>module.exports</em> pattern to client-side development. A good working knowledge of JavaScript and some experience of Node.js is essential for this workshop.</p>
<h2>Learning React</h2><p>A series of three one-day workshops on Facebook&#39;s <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/"><em>React</em></a>â€”a declarative, efficient and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://ti.to/founders-coders/begin-react-workshop">May 30th</a>: How to think in React</strong><br>The first of is an introductory, interactive workshop in which you will be introduced to the <strong>fundamental concepts</strong> of React, learn how to <strong>set up your dev environment</strong> for an optimal workflow, and how to start building your own <strong>library of components</strong> for reuse across projects. Some knowledge of JavaScript is expected, but other than that, all you need is a laptop and an inquisitive mind!  </p>
<p><strong>Building a real-world app in React</strong><br>A follow-up to <em>How to think in React</em>, in which we will learn how to apply the concepts already learnt through <strong>building an app</strong>. To get the most out of this workshop, you will either have attended <em>How to think in React</em> or will already have a good working knowledge of React fundamentals.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Flux</strong><br>In the third of three workshops on <em>React</em>,  we will be converting a purely <em>React</em> app into one built with the <em>Flux</em> design pattern. By doing so, you will be able to see why you might want to use Flux if you&#39;re using React, and how you might start going about changing your app accordingly.  To get the most out of this workshop, you will either have attended our earlier workshops or you will have some experience with using React, and you understand the difference between <em>state</em> and <em>props</em>, where state should lie, and how components can set the state of other components.</p>
